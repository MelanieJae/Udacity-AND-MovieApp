# Movie Search App

This app allows the user to search for movies using the following modes:

1. Most Popular
2. Top-rated


These search modes/choices can be accessed by clicking on the dropdown menu in the top right corner of the main screen. The main view by default shows upcoming movies.

Once a search mode has been selected, a grid of movie titles and poster thumbanils will appear. The user may then click on any of these to view the details for the movie.

## Developer Notes:

This app was created using the Gradle build system.
